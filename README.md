*Created Align Tool*
This tool will align all selected objects on the chosen axis. 
It does this through assigning the average of the position of all 
objects on the specific chosen axis so they are aligned. 
i.e. if you aligned the x, y, and z values of some objects then they all
would be centered in the exact same spot on the scene.
